/**
 * Represents the physical quantity of **luminous flux**, measured in lumens (lm).
 *
 * One lumen is the luminous flux emitted in a solid angle of one steradian by a point source with a luminous
 * intensity of one candela. In SI, it is defined as cdÂ·sr.
 *
 * Lumens are widely used in lighting to describe the total perceived power of light emitted.
 *
 * This class expresses luminous flux as a combination of a [magnitude] and a [prefix], supporting values such as
 * millilumens (mlm), kilolumens (klm), or megalumens (Mlm).
 *
 * Instances of this class are immutable and use [BigDecimal] for precision.
