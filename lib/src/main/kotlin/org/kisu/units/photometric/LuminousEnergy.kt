/**
 * Represents **luminous energy**.
 *
 * Luminous energy (also known as *quantity of light*) is the measure of the
 * perceived amount of light emitted over a period of time.
 *
 * It is defined as the time integral of luminous flux and is expressed in
 * **lumen-seconds (lmÂ·s)**.
 *
 * This quantity is important in photometry when evaluating the total amount
 * of light delivered by a source during a given interval.
 *
 * @constructor Creates a luminous energy measure with the given [magnitude]
 * and [expression].
 * @param magnitude The numeric value of the measure.
 * @param expression The unit expression in lumen-seconds.
