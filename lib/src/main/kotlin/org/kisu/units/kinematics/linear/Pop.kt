/**
 * Represents the physical quantity of **pop**, the sixth derivative of position with respect to time.
 *
 * Pop quantifies how the **crackle** (fifth derivative of position) changes over time.
 * Its SI unit is the **metre per second to the sixth (m/s‚Å∂)**, represented here by [MetrePerSecondSixth].
 *
 * Pop is mainly used in highly precise motion analysis, such as:
 * - Advanced robotics and trajectory smoothing
 * - High-order physics simulations
 * - Studies of motion requiring very fine-grained derivative analysis
 *
 * The magnitude is stored as a [BigDecimal] to ensure high precision. Instances of [Pop] are
 * immutable, and the [expression] parameter ties the measurement to its unit representation ([MetrePerSecondSixth]).
 *
 * @property magnitude The numeric value of the pop.
 * @property expression The unit expression of the pop, always [MetrePerSecondSixth].
