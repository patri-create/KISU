/**
 * Represents the physical quantity of **frequency drift**, the rate of change of frequency over time.
 *
 * Frequency drift quantifies how quickly a frequency changes with respect to time.
 * Its SI unit is the **hertz per second (Hz/s)**, represented here by [HertzPerSecond].
 *
 * Typical applications include:
 * - Monitoring clock stability in electronics and timekeeping devices
 * - Signal processing and communication systems
 * - Oscillator or resonator performance analysis
 *
 * The magnitude is stored as a [BigDecimal] to ensure high precision. Instances of [FrequencyDrift] are
 * immutable, and the [expression] parameter ties the measurement to its unit representation ([HertzPerSecond]).
 *
 * @property magnitude The numeric value of the frequency drift.
 * @property expression The unit expression of the frequency drift, always [HertzPerSecond].

     * - Describing chirp signals or frequency sweeps in signal processing
     * - Measuring acceleration of rotational speed in machinery
