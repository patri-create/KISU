/**
 * Represents the physical quantity of **angular crackle**, the fifth derivative of angular position with respect to
 * time.
 *
 * Angular crackle quantifies how the **angular snap** (fourth derivative of angular position) changes over time.
 * Its SI unit is the **radian per second to the fifth (rad/s‚Åµ)**, represented here by [RadianPerSecondFifth].
 *
 * Typical applications include:
 * - Advanced robotics and precise rotational motion planning
 * - High-fidelity physics simulations of rotational systems
 * - Systems where higher-order derivatives of angular motion are relevant for stability or smoothness
 *
 * The magnitude is stored as a [BigDecimal] to ensure high precision. Instances of [AngularCrackle] are
 * immutable, and the [expression] parameter ties the measurement to its unit representation ([RadianPerSecondFifth]).
 *
 * @property magnitude The numeric value of the angular crackle.
 * @property expression The unit expression of the angular crackle, always [RadianPerSecondFifth].
