/**
 * Represents the physical quantity of **crackle**, the fifth derivative of position with respect to time.
 *
 * Crackle quantifies how the **jerk (third derivative of position)** changes over time.
 * Its SI unit is the **metre per second to the fifth (m/s‚Åµ)**, represented here by [MetrePerSecondFifth].
 *
 * This quantity is mainly used in higher-order kinematics and precise motion analysis, such as:
 * - Advanced robotics and trajectory planning
 * - Smooth motion control systems
 * - Physics simulations requiring higher-order derivatives of position
 *
 * The magnitude is stored as a [BigDecimal] to ensure high precision. Instances of [Crackle] are
 * immutable, and the [expression] parameter ties the measurement to its unit representation ([MetrePerSecondFifth]).
 *
 * @property magnitude The numeric value of the crackle.
 * @property expression The unit expression of the crackle, always [MetrePerSecondFifth].
