/**
 * Represents the physical quantity of **angular snap**, the fourth derivative of angular position with respect to time.
 *
 * Angular snap quantifies how the **angular jerk** (third derivative of angular position) changes over time.
 * Its SI unit is the **radian per second to the fourth (rad/s‚Å¥)**, represented here by [RadianPerSecondFourth].
 *
 * Typical applications include:
 * - Robotics and rotational motion control for smooth higher-order trajectories
 * - Physics simulations requiring precise modeling of angular derivatives beyond acceleration
 * - Systems where control of the change of angular jerk is necessary for stability or comfort
 *
 * The magnitude is stored as a [BigDecimal] to ensure high precision. Instances of [AngularSnap] are
 * immutable, and the [expression] parameter ties the measurement to its unit representation ([RadianPerSecondFourth]).
 *
 * @property magnitude The numeric value of the angular snap.
 * @property expression The unit expression of the angular snap, always [RadianPerSecondFourth].
