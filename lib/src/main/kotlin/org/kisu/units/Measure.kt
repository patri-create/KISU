/**
 * Represents a physical quantity composed of a [magnitude], a [prefix], and a [unit].
 *
 * This generic class models measurements in a unit system with metric-style prefixes,
 * such as meters, grams, or seconds.
 *
 * It is designed to support operations like addition, subtraction, scaling, and conversion
 * between compatible units with automatic prefix normalization (e.g., converting 1000 millimeters to 1 meter).
 *
 * @param Prefix The type representing the system of prefixes (e.g., [Metric]).
 *        It must implement both [System] (to provide ordering and base relations)
 *        and [org.kisu.prefixes.Prefix] (to support scaling operations).
 *
 * @param Self The concrete subclass type used for safe covariant returns.
 *        This is a common pattern to support fluent APIs in hierarchies.
 *
 * @property magnitude The numerical value of the measurement in the specified [prefix].
 * @property prefix The metric prefix applied to the unit (e.g., `kilo`, `milli`).
 *        This determines the scale of the [magnitude] relative to the base unit.
 * @property unit A string representing the unit symbol (e.g., `"m"` for meters, `"g"` for grams).
 *
 * @constructor Protected to enforce instantiation via factory methods or subclasses.
 *
 * @see System for prefix ordering and canonical base relationships.
 * @see org.kisu.prefixes.Prefix for scaling behavior.
