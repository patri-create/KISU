/**
 * Represents a combination of a [Prefix] and a unit symbol, forming a complete unit expression
 * such as "km" (kilo + meter) or "Î¼s" (micro + second).
 *
 * This class serves as the foundational abstraction for units with prefixes in a measurement system.
 * It inherits from both [Prefix] and [System], ensuring that the expression behaves consistently
 * within prefix and system operations.
 *
 * Equality is based on the unit symbol, meaning that two expressions are considered equal
 * if they share the same symbol, regardless of their internal structure.
 *
 * @param A the type of prefix used in this expression.
